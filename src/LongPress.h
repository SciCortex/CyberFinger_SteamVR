// LongPress.h — a button with a long-press function (the black button: its
// long press is a second input, /input/a_hold)
//
// A press is held back until it's known which it is: released before `hold`,
// it's passed on as a click when it ends (reported for at least `click` seconds
// so every app sees it); held for `hold`, the long press fires once and the app
// never sees the button. Held back, because apps act on the press: Resonite opens
// its dash on it, so a long press passed on as it happened would open the dash.
// The price: the button reports on release, and can't be held in an app.
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
