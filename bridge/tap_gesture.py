"""Triple tap on the glove's joint IMU (the module on the back of the hand), like SlimeVR's reset tap: the bridge
then asks the driver to resync its IMU fusion.

A tap is a spike in the accelerometer: the change between two consecutive samples (~8 ms apart) far beyond what the
hand's own motion gives. Worn normally the change stays under 0.9 g (captures 2026-09-26/27); vigorous throws reach
several g, but not three in a steady rhythm with the hand otherwise still, which is what a triple tap is: three
spikes 0.1-0.5 s apart, the samples between them calm. Over 6 minutes of those captures no threshold from 0.8 to
2 g found a single triple tap, even without the calm test.
