"""Bridge → CyberFinger commands on the VR GATT control characteristic (0xCF02; firmware src/vr_gatt.h).

  VR_CMD_HAPTIC  0x10   cmd u8, amplitude u8 (0..255, 0 stops), duration_ms u16 LE, frequency_hz u16 LE  (6 bytes)

A SteamVR haptic event (the driver's CFHP, driver_link.py) becomes one VR_CMD_HAPTIC, written without response.
Firmware 1.3.3+ drives its DRV2605L + ERM motor with it (src/haptics.h: every pulse lasts at least ~35 ms, the
motor's spin-up; back-to-back requests extend the vibration); older firmware logs an unknown command and ignores
it, as do boards without the motor.

HapticSender does the writing from the BLE manager's asyncio loop, per hand, coalescing: while a write is in
flight, later requests merge into one (the latest amplitude and frequency, the longest duration), so an app that
pulses every frame can't queue up a backlog on the BLE link.
